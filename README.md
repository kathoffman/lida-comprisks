![](output/graphs/figure_alluvial.pdf)

This repository contains the code used to generate the application for [*Causal survival analysis under competing risks using longitudinal modified treatment policies* (Diaz, Hoffman, and Hejazi 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03513).

The data set (data/derived/dat_final.rds) is synthetic, since the actual data set used contains protected health information.
